# My Little Journal

## What is this?
A Journalling app for the minimalist. An app to guide an individual on their mental health journey.

## What does it do?
- Create, update and delete your reflections
- Allow personal comments on your own reflections after a certain time
- Colour codes your musings based on sentiment

## What else will it do next time?
- You can ask an AI assistant how to improve your mood, or talk about your day to them. (Powered by OpenAI)
- Securely access your musings via SAML SSO
- If the sentiment analytics algorithm detects suicidal journal entries, a popup will recommend the user to speak to someone.

## Are these features all here yet
No. I've just started building this

## Why did you start building this?
Bored on a Saturday afternoon. Wanted to see if I could integrate some kind of sentiment analytics and Generative AI tools into Laravel.

## When will this be done
Not sure. It will always be a work in progress... Fingers crossed that I don't abandon this.
